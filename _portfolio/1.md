The East Asian monsoon represents one of the most important components of the global climate system. Its evolution and variability can significantly influence the vegetation, populations, economies, and even cultures that inhabit Asian monsoon regions (including the Indian sub-continent, southeast, and East Asia). Using peatlands, lake, and sand-paleosol records, I have conducted multiple proxies based reconstructions (including pollen, phytolith, charcoal, and geochemical indicators) to understand how the past East Asian monsoon climate changed and how it regulates the landscape dynamics.
