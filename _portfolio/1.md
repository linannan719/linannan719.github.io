The East Asian monsoon is an essential component of the global climate system, with its evolution and variability exerting profound impacts on the vegetation, populations, economies, and even cultures within the regions it influences. 

In my research, I have utilized various geological records, including those from peatlands, lakes, and sand-paleosols. Through these records, I've conducted multiple proxy-based reconstructions, employing proxies such as pollen analysis, phytolith examination, charcoal assessments, and geochemical indicators. These reconstructions aim to elucidate the historical changes in the East Asian monsoon climate and its role in shaping landscape dynamics.
