Hi! I’m Nannan, now a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Geological Oceanography ([DGO](https://dgo.xmu.edu.cn))  of [Xiamen University](https://www.xmu.edu.cn). I’m a paleoclimatologists employ a wide variety of techniques to deduce ancient climates during the past. Similar to the way archeologists study fossils and other physical clues to gain insight into the prehistoric past, my research focuses on geological evidence to understand what Earth’s past climate was like and why. 


Research Interest
======
As a paleoclimatologist and paleoecologist, I am working on a variety of climate archives, including peatlands, lacustrine sediments, and marine cores. Using the Last Deglaciation (19-11.6 kyr, analogous continuous warming) and mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum (8-4 kyr, analogous 1-2°C global warming) as analogous scenarios for future climate warming, one primary goal of my research is to obtain a better understanding of the signature and biological consequences of the climate change in the East Asian monsoon region.  It is therefore not surprising that my research interests and experience span a wide range of topics from paleoclimate, paleoecology, geochemistry, to archaeology and climate modelling. Because of the strong interdisciplinary nature of my research, I have developed a rich network of national and international collaborations.

Biography
======
I received a B.A. in Geography from [School of Geographical Sciences](http://geo.nenu.edu.cn), [Northeast Normal University](http://www.nenu.edu.cn) in 2014 and a Ph.D. in Physical Geography in 2020. During my Ph.D., I visited the [Sedimentology Group](https://www.eawag.ch/en/department/surf/main-focus/sedimentology/) (led by Prof. [Nathalie Dubois](https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/nathalie-dubois/show/))at [Eawag](https://www.eawag.ch/en/) in Swizterland and the [Stable Isotope Laboratory](https://www.cerege.fr/fr/equipements/poles-techniques/analyse-des-isotopes-stables-paniss-2/) at Centre Européen de Recherche et d’Enseignement des Géosciences de l’Environnement ([CEREGE](https://www.cerege.fr/en/), hosted by Dr. [Anne Alexandre](https://www.cerege.fr/en/cerege/anne-alexandre/)). Following my doctoral work, I worked a post-doctoral researcher at  Xiamen University. Starting from March 1st, I worked as a INQUA Fellowship funded joint (visiting) Postdoc at Eawag (host: Prof. [Nathalie Dubois](https://www.eawag.ch/en/about-us/portrait/organisation/staff/profile/nathalie-dubois/show/)).
